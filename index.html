		<h1>The Veiled White</h1>
		<p>The sonar readings grew quiet. Pulses traveled from the ship, never to echo back. The Queen Regale had been sailing over a dead zone for hours, and a heavy silence consumed the crew’s sanguine quest for treasure. The black arctic waters seemed to be devoid of everything from plankton to whale. Navigation systems were offline and a thick, gray cover of clouds blotted out the sun, snuffing out the shadow on Tristen’s sun dial—a relic he found on his first hunt. They sailed, lost at sea, for the bulk of the day. From the ship’s deck, Tristen glared into the horizon, resenting its emptiness. Still waters spread out in all directions, with not even the presence of a light wind to ruffle the glass-like surface. The vacancy wore on the treasure hunter's ambition, and his drive waned under the gloomy assault. He had the best crew on the water—a staunch cast with decades of experience. The idea of the Queen Regale losing her way was absurd—even unimaginable. Yet, here they were, lost at sea.

		“Blue!"	Tristen's first mate, Jamie O’Shay, rushed up on deck in panic.

		"What is it?" Tristen answered, turning to face his most trusted friend. 

		As tense as his tone, Jamie continued, raking his fingers through his hair. “I thought we might have picked up on a whale's song, but it was more unearthly. Whatever made that sound was NOT from this world."

		Tristen's brows furrowed. Normally, such news would pique his interest and spark the explorer in him, but beyond  Jamie’s frightened expression, and out into the far distance, he spotted a disruption on the water. Before he could speak his guess at what it was, he heard  Jamie confirm his thought.

		“It can only be a rogue wave. A quake did register with the onset of that strange hum, but Tsunami’s don’t reach heights in deep seas…”  Trailing off, Jamie turned to face the looming threat, awestruck by its size. “Whatever it is, it’s going to kill us, Blue.”

		In spite of the certain doom on the horizon, Tristen's zeal would not allow for him to balk at the twist in their fate. If perdition was inevitable, then the treasure hunter would lead his crew into it with zest.

		"You have the helm, mate! Go! Go! Go!” The bark of Tristen's order set the bewildered sailor into motion. “All hands on deck!!"

		The ship's siren blared in warning, calling the crew to their stations.

		"Approaching wave due in nine minutes and thirty-six seconds!” Jamie roared from the helm.

		“Full speed ahead! Let’s take this fucker head on!” Tristan ordered.

		Taking in the panic of their defense, Tristen noticed its contrast to the dead calm of their immediate surroundings. The ocean waters were still like glass, not even ruffled by the threat barreling toward them. Ruination promised, he marveled at the macabre ambiance.

		“Approaching wave, six minutes out! Secure the hatches, men!”

		Tristen and the remaining four men of the crew scurried for their survival, tying down equipment, bolting doors, and closing windows. Despair threatened courage, tempting the men’s surrender, but Tristen’s call-to-fight snapped them from temptation’s snare.

		“Move yer asses! Gear up fuckers! It’s gon’ take more than a wave to dethrone The Queen!”

		The men rushed to suit up and then took their stations, each struggling with the thought of his own end.

		“Two minutes to impact! Brace yourselves and fight this fucker with all you got. Y’all better show it hell if it aims to deliver ya there!”

		Tristen charged from one crew member to the other, pounding his palm into each of their backs—a gesture meant to keep them in the here and now of surviving this onslaught.

		“Thirty seconds, men! BRACE YOURSELVES!

		The Queen sped forward en route to rise up its swell, but the wave, traveling at jetspeed, crashed into the ship, sending it reeling back on its stern before swallowing it like a pebble. The hard-hitting water snapped the bowsprit from the front of the ship and tore the rigging away faster than the eye could measure. On the bridge, the crew fought to ground themselves, thrusting strong reaches for anything that might keep them stationary. The ship’s wheel cranked so hard, its spin tossed Jamie from the helm. Tristen watched as his first mate slammed into the floor; amidst all the ruckus, he swore he could hear his skull crack.

		“Jamie!” Tristen roared.

		Jamie tried to ground himself, but disorientation had him clambering around aimlessly.

		“JAMIE! Over here!”

		Tristen and the others managed to secure themselves, but with Jamie unsecured and half-conscious, the flailing ship tossed him to and fro like a rag doll. In the swift pace of the calamity, wit waned to instinct and the men battled for position, for final impact, for their lives. But Tristen had each of them in his sights. By chance, the spin of the ship shifted to send Jamie flying in Tristen’s direction.

		“My hand! Grab it!” Tristen hollered.

		The friends' stretched arms latched together in a hearty grip that broke the momentum of Jamie's fall. A second of relief passed between the two. Jamie's weary gaze locked onto Tristen's bright blue eyes—a sliver in time that would be his last. A trophy anchor suddenly dislodged from the wall and hurled across the bridge, smashing through Jamie's skull and into the window. The pressure of the water outside the ship absorbed the anchor's impact against the glass, buying part of a moment. A web of cracks quickly crawled over the window—the prelude to their end.

		The remaining men froze in fear, their eyes glazed over as each whispered pleas to his God. Even Tristen knew it was time to accept this fate. In truth, a part of him always knew the ocean would be his graveyard, and in truth, he wanted it that way. As the window shattered and the water gushed in, the treasure hunter threw his arms up and stepped into the rushing water, belching out a throaty laugh. Seconds later, the onslaught choked out his cackle and claimed the Queen Regale, filling her hull and sucking her into the ocean’s depths.</p>
		<center>***</center>
		<p>Tristen's lungs revolted against the water's ingress. Blacked-out during his ascent to the water's surface, he missed the serendipity of his rescue. He woke choking on sea water, puking up its salty mix. The sailor fought to tread water and gather his bearings, searching for survivors, debris, anything he could cling to. But he found only still waters—warm, still, tropical waters. Exhausted and beat down from the wave's attack, he assumed he was suffering delusion—or had crossed over to some oceanic after life. And then, darkness took him again. Barely held afloat by his life jacket, the shipwrecked treasure hunter drifted in and out of consciousness, with each awakening filled with misery. His head pounded. His throat felt so dry, he thought it might have cracked open. He lost track of time. He wondered if such suffering was felt by the dead, and deciding that it was not, he wished for death—but all he was granted was another bout of unconsciousness. The next time he woke, he found himself face down with a mouthful of sand. Spitting the gritty concoction, he brought himself to his knees. Glancing around, he thought he was suffering from some sort of temporary color blindness. Everything from the sand to the  trees was white. He dug his palms into his eye sockets, rubbing vigorously to no avail. Still struggling for focus, he stumbled, and then rose to his feet. Fighting against the weakness that weighed him, he took a hard look around, bewildered at the vision of a white island oasis.</p>

		<h1>Gravity</h1>
		<p>Before me, he is frightening yet exquisite. Breath locked, I stand. I dare not blink for fear I miss a second of this experience. It is nothing to me, yet it is everything. Nothing, in that it is a mere face to face encounter with a man I do not even know. Everything, in that the enigma of his presence brings my blood to race, waking an unprecedented vivification within me. My heart sets rhythm to the thrill.

		 Buh-bom.

		 Buh-bom Buh-bom.

		 Buh-bom Buh-bom Buh-bom.

		The advance of his hand should draw my guard—spark hints of resistance at the least. But as his palm cups my face, I find myself exhaling in surrender to his touch. The submission spills into a hard shiver and the cold bite to the gentle cradling brings still the air in my chest once more.

		His hand... so cold.

		Why?

		Logic begs to be heard, but its message airs trivial. Amber eyes brimming with my need to escape myself look up and stare into the expanse of his.

		Who is he? What is he?

		It is as if time has paused with even the air in suspension, and the only thing that seems to carry motion is my drumming heart. Its rhythm ripples over the round of a static bosom. My cheeks warm under his cool touch, and when his lips journey close to deliver his address, it is as if his whisper carries the charge of an electric current. A surge of tingles shoots down my back, igniting a searing sensation through my core. He has just claimed me with his greeting, and I am powerless to stop him. Drawn into his embrace in a feat that defies gravity, I cede to the tender command. Willful captive. La petite mort. Prelude to my end.

		A fantastic presence, he flaunts an aura of a full ventured life, one that has seen many perils and many pleasures. My attraction to him grows to a prodigious potency, an all-consuming force that conquers all esprit. I am slave to his will. In a salacious lure, his tongue feathers over my still pout. Kiss tempted, lips part. My gusting breath is swallowed up as his lips close down on mine. I offer him motionless surrender—but he is no glutton. He leaves me wanting. I find myself whimpering into the kiss, and the sound begs his ravening just as it prompts a slight rouse from the trance I had fallen victim to.

		What are we doing? What am I doing?

		Glimpses of my beloved beau back home flash in my mind. Hints of my wit return to me. The sobering reminds me that I did not fly across the world for a one night stand. Yet, as if whisked from my reality, I find myself in the grip of a seduction so sublime, it has annihilated my faithfulness and abolished my vows unchallenged.

		"Wait..."

		A futile resistance rolls from my lips. Its timbre betrays me, airing thick with a sultry lust. My eyes search his and find them ripe with his intent. They assure me that he will not accept any refusal on my part; and I am not so sure that I will refuse him. Still, I try to resist.

		"I - I can't..."

		But I choke on what I want to say. The raw power of his presence begins to smother me, and so I step back from him in small, slow, dubious steps. I find them to be the most difficult steps I have ever taken. My mind toils to spin free of his pull on me. This is beyond the scope of humanity, and I do not quite understand it. Part of me yearns to indulge him, and the other is terrified of him. I  look around and take in my surroundings, finding little relief in what I see. We are alone on the roof a towering Amsterdam hotel.

		Why did I come up here?

		No memory of my trek to this height offers an answer. I could fall victim to a rendezvous with the vile, the baleful, with death itself; none would be the wiser. Not a soul knew I was up here.

		No one, but him.

		Suddenly, a flurry of night air swirls around me sending long strands of my hair to whip across my face, blinding me. Frenetic working fingers comb the locks from my face, giving me glimpses of the roof top view, but there is no longer any sign of the bewitching stranger. Fighting against the hearty gusts in a fervid endeavor, I am almost thrown off balance as the whirling wind abruptly stops. My head whips around, searching for him in an excited fright. Not even a hint of the mysterious male is to be found, and the gasps escaping me express my shock.  I try to make some sense of what just happened, questioning whether or not it was even real. But the void that I feel in his absence tells me that it was indeed real. The empty pit quickly fills with an anguish not natural to the event, leaving my chest tingling with a deep ache. And just like I could not resist his presence, I cannot bear his absence.

		"Please come back!"

		What is this I feel?

		A yearning cascades through me, demanding to be sated. Glimpses of his kiss swarm me, and my desire for him brings me ripe with carnal need. I ache for him. Seduced. Bewildered. The night scape glitters with a sea of city lights spreading out for miles in all directions around me, mirrored by the speckled sky. And in the grand scheme of it, I am just a hint of existence, blind in the macabre affair of predator and prey.

		With only a hint of a breeze to announce his return, robust arms wrap me up from behind. A cool caress of fingertips is felt sweeping down the side of my neck, pulling my hair to the side. The bliss of pleasure pervades my being—and then, a pierce. Two barbed fangs slice into the cushion of my flesh en route to the blue cord running down my neck. The savage of his appetite is felt—but I fret not. Instead, a calming rushes over me. The friction of his bite serves the last heat I feel, and as he draws the crimson life from my vein, my body begins to grow cold. So cold. Fading fast, I am powerless, with any instinct to survive slipping away with my blood.

		 Buh-bom Buh-bom Buh-bom.

		 Buh-bom Buh-bom.

		 My breathing halts.

		 Buh-bom.

		 Buh.

		 Bom.</p></section>

		<h1>Curse of the Wolf</h1>
		<p>There was a certain intrusiveness about the way gusting winds slapped at those with the poor luck of being caught in their path. The aggravation of this particular assault was so obtrusive, that it provoked the release of Bones' hearty growl into its force. And how quick these whipping flurries were to swat away the textured groan! So abruptly ripped from his lips that it would not even be heard, dissipating in the windy hiss as if it never were. Fumbling fingers worked in fervor to bring a tighter wind to his scarf. His head bowed to lead scrunched shoulders against the stormy winds, but the charge felt more like a collision than a ramming through.

		Only one block left to go, and should a taxi pass, he would hail it at once. As if to oppose his mental plea for escape, the onslaught suddenly spewed balls of air with enough velocity to put him off his step. Then, as if a grand finale were in order, the wind slammed him with enough of a blast to send him back one, two, three steps before whipping the flap of his tote open and catching the edge of a report he had spent days preparing and hours perfecting. Off in the whirling wind it flew, blowing up in a taunting twirl before the storm hurried it away.

		Battling the tempest, he tromped after the bustling papers, cursing into the alpaca fleece wrapping his face. Frenetic working hands hurled flailing reaches after the littered report until he finally surrendered to the futility of the endeavor and gave up. In the chaos of the loss, he decided that checking his tote for the flash drive would be the better pursuit. And so his scurry gave way to a more focused effort. Still Bones' toiling was executed in vain and his search cut short by a shrill howl—not like the eerie baritone offered by the gusting winds, but something closer to the call of beast.

		"Odd," he thought. "Wolves were not known for frequenting the city, but then... that cry... did not sound quite like a wolf."

		The raucous timbre unnerved him, bringing his trek to a complete halt. In a phase of paralysis he tensed in fear—that moment when the prey realizes his predator. Though blowing dust fogged visibility, the darting shadow closing in on him exploded into sight. Only with great effort was he able to break through the panic holding him in place and step from its ensnaring grip. A pivot later, he came face to face with the shrieking beast, his gaze falling on snapping jaws before the creature encased him in a flesh splitting grip, sending him to darkness before the frenzied feed even hit the ground.

		So imagine the surprise when his blood crusted lids sprang open to focus on the overcast of the morning sky.

		Someone, or something, had interrupted the slaughter, leaving him to survive the attack—though there was not a soul to be found for aid or witness. It was just as well. He didn't exactly want to share the shame of the horrific awakening. But the greater horror would come with the realization that the beast had passed its infection through its bite. To add to the headache that was his life, Bones inherited a curse that left him subject to the pull of the moon. He became lycanthrope, proving the legends true. Hiding this misfortune brought such stress, he began to isolate himself, refusing even the companionship of the ladies he once welcomed with rapacity. He replaced their company with the ever reliable Macallan. But there comes a time when the palate turns numb under drunkenness, and the liquor goes down without regard. Bones fell into such times more and more, drinking himself into a drunken stupors—with one occurring during last night’s full moon.

		A bloody feasting ensued, but Bones would not be able detail it or remember it in whole. The wolf beast claimed the mind just as it took over the body. Prisoner to the savage that dwelt within, he usually shackled himself in the basement, but last night his only restraint was a bottle of scotch. This curse had been with him for eight months now. In that time, he made three kills. The first two deaths occurring the night of the first full moon following his attack—a night that continued to play out in execrable flashbacks; and the other death occurred during last night's full moon. The morning news did the honor of detailing his kill, naming Bones' victim, and ensuring that he witnessed fragments of loved ones' grief. And as ghastly as the news story sounded, he knew it didn't begin to touch on the graphic nature of the kill. The bits of flesh and bone that littered his blood soaked bed assured him of that. Between blood-stained fingers, the white paper wrapping his tobacco came to be littered with his red prints. A deep drag brought its end to a long ember. The smoke of his exhale quickly faded away, and with it, the last shred of his inner peace.</p>

		<h1>Diary of a Deviant</h1>
		<p>There’s not much I remember about my childhood. What glimpses my mind offers are not pleasant. I remember wearing an unruly mop of hair. Not sure I knew how to comb it or if my parents even tended to me in that way. At best, my fingers plucked strands from the knot that gathered at the base of my skull. One hot summer, lice infested the mousey-brown nest. The itching nearly drove me mad. Filthy nails dug ruts into an inflamed scalp, prompting an infection and earning me a trip to the school nurse. The plump, rosy-cheeked blonde assured me that all would be remedied.

		"Oh sweetie, we will get this taken care of. Don’t you worry."

		Imagine my confusion when my father waxed my ass later that night. In the end, I finally got my mop chopped and head medicated.

		A recurring nightmare fills another glimpse from that time. In the scene it plays out, a giant mummy rises from one side of my bed while I sit on the edge of the other. Ass glued to mattress, I labor for freedom. The monster forms a giant fist, wrapped in dirty white strips, and as it thrusts forward, I open my mouth to cry out. The silent scream proves a futile alarm. Impact imminent, the balled up hand plows me to an oblivion.

		Other glimpses reveal aberrant pieces to my tale. But the glimpse I’d just soon forget? Resounding gunshots in the night.

		BOOM, BOOM, BOOM, BOOM.

		My eyes shot open, but only to take in the thick black of my dark room.

		BOOM.

		The darkness sheltered me from the visual of my mother’s murder. Later, my father would tell me it was meant as a game. Five bullets in the barrel, and the sixth shot was supposed to be a click at her head.

		Miscount.

		While public school assured me that my life was a fall short of the all-American family and the privilege of a white picket fence, foster care opened my world to a different reality. One fucked-up childhood hardly stands apart from another. New friends offered a salve to the wound left by my mother’s death, and with time, the sting of the tragedy waned. I gathered confidence, and as I grew, I rummaged an intellect sharper than the blade in my pocket. School failed to challenge me. A leader in my peer group, I defied teachers and other forms of authority—often by the forbidden act of wielding a finely-tuned wit. Truancy, suspension, and detention filled my record. At home, my foster mother restricted me to the basement, locking me away when all else failed. It was there that I discovered my passion for literature. Sifting through boxes of books earned me the privilege of exploring the minds of Twain, Emerson, Hawthorne, Poe, and Thoreau. “Resistance to Civil Government.” That fucker was so far ahead of his time. In these books, I discovered people I could respect—and in that, I found the first sliver of guidance I could cling to. Independence ensued.
		Soon after, I ran away.

		I admit, life on the streets challenged me. In the end, I slipped by many a heavy consequence. Death often hovered, at times reaching out for me—but only to claw at my back.
		I conclude that the devil has plans for me. Accepting that a God of love would deal me such a shitty fate leaves me too conflicted. Certain that God has abandoned me, I cling to that which rivals him.

		A deep thinker, I find reprieve from the storms of my thoughts in writing. Everything from poetry, to lyrics, to journaling my thoughts flows from my pen. An accomplished diarist, I am. I confess with ink what I dare not speak to another. Trust issues.I also have a fear of being locked up or tied down. I panic when my open space is threatened. I toil endlessly for escape. Settling for thrills, I chase adventure. Boredom sends me to a dark place, and the burn of grief, guilt, and shame? Countered with pain. Masochist. It all leads to habits that label me a deviant. And when I fall silent? Hair-trigger to violence.
		I’m unstoppable in a blackout.

		I expect that one day, I will discover what it’s all for. Why I was brought to this life, and why I endure. I connect with few in the sea of simple minds that surrounds me. Peculiar phobias hound me. A swarm of bugs and I dance like a bitch. Bad breath will have me retching. I claim this is the reason I don’t like to kiss, but in truth, the act is far too personal. Too intimate. I took a shot at love, sure. Don’t we all? But it was only to discover that I don’t measure up to the type I want. No person worth loving will love the likes of me. So I settle for who I am. For what I know. And the notion that the devil has plans for me.</p>
